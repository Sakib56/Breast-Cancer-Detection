# Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis
This is my approach at implementing KNN from scratch and applying it to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. 
### knn.py
This file current contains two methods.
knn.predict(data, sample, k=n)
where...
data is the training data i.e. an n by m matrix of row vectors (which are the datapoints),
sample is a single row vector i.e. 1 by m
and k is the number of nearest neighbours the algorithm will consider before classifying sample.
### cancer.py
### data.csv
The data file acquired from Kaggle at: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data
